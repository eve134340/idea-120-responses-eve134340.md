Linguistic: In the photo we see two boys that look scared/frighten, as well we see a white house with a shadow in the window. The only text we see in the photo is “Villisca Ax Murder House.”

Connoted (symbolic): The message in this thumbnail (clickbate) is telling the viewer that the youtube video is going to be “scary” by the paranormal activity that is going to happen in the murder house that Sam and Colby are going. As well by adding their "scared" faces into the thumbnail is basically telling the viewer that whatever happens in the video is legit. 

Denoted: The message here is trying to attract viewers (and new ones) by creating an over exaggerated thumbnail, since that would be the first thing that people would see. As well telling their fans to check their new video.
