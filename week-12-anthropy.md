Video games need to be more diverse because most of the audience playing video games are cis males. As well most of video games are towards young teenage boys. Not only that but those who create these games are mostly white males that create these games. As well having more diverse games invite people to join and not get bored with the same story line or seeing a similar face that might be from a completely different game.

Creating video games is limited to a small group of people because game designers and publishers need a college degree which for many it isnt affordable. By having free tools on the internet and making it easy for those who have no clue how to code, it would bring a lot of diverisity for those who are interesting in creating a game. Which can break the chain of having the same story lines or the same shooting game.

As well having a diverse people representing these games makes games be more creative. Like I mentioned before having the same people (white cis males) create basically the same game over and over again. By haivng a more welcome environment and letting in people with different backgrounds these games change, they turn out to be more creative. They create art with these games as they express themselves, which makes gamers get engulfed. 

There’s this game that ive been playing called “Genshin Impact.” Where the character Aether (or Lumine) are willing to to go to all the seven nations to find their lost sibing. While trying to find their sibling you are given task and and the story line is just amazing. Which really gets you engulfed.
