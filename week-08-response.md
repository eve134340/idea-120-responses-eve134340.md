Everyone is being tracked by almost all sites, knowing what the person have previously clicked and go on by their history. Sites are programmed like this to advertise what the user might like or what the user might like to see. I have always experienced this, I would do a simple google search and whenever I would open a new tab or go to a website I would get an ad on what i previously googled searched not only in websites i would get ads but also in social media. Not only by searching something but as well whenever I would tell someone what I need. They always prey on peopleâ€™s lives to just to try to get profit from them. 

I believe that the internet would be more useful without these methods because these methods are advertising/showing fake news or misinformation. Some people would believe anything that they would see in the internet because they think that everything in the internet is reliable. I have some family members who actually believe anything from the internet and sometimes would spread misinformation to others without knowing its misinformation. Not only that but big companies would do anything to have advertise their products and take away they spotlight from small business.
