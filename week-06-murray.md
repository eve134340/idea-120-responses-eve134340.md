I believe that Murray’s prediction turned out to be accurate. The prediction being that their would be a combination of the television and the computer. We see this today how we have streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus etc. Where back then we would have to use DVDs or have to rent a box to see all the other channels in the TV. Now today everyone can just watch a movie through their phone and rarely use the a DVD, even kids today won’t even know what a DVD or a VHS is. I ended up growing up with watching cable at home and going through the pain of watching every single ad just to continue watching a cartoon, as well paying for cable TV would be expensive. My whole family stoped paying for cable tv around five years now and now watch their tv through streaming sites 

In the Mandolorian I think that the actors and scenes use the results of Murray’s predictions. Even how its created like back in the days many companies would have to go to certain spots to film a certain scene and later would have to move to a whole new location. Now in days movie productions use green screens to create the scenery and CGI to make create special affects. Although when the actors are acting they won’t see what in their surrounding.
