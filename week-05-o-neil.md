# WDM

WDM’s are “Weapons of Mass of Math Destruction,” WDM is basically numbers, formulas, data, basically they weaponized math to hurt others, while the others don’t know that they are being hurt. WMD would be how there is a big barrier between high and low income communities. 

One example can be in Healthcare, where many of those who have a low income or that are considered low class would get discriminated by treating them unfairly. As well some can’t even afford it due to all the bill that they have to pay or because they aren’t below the minimum wage. Because of our healthcare system some have not even visited the doctors or get the treatment that they need. As well there some healthcare insurance that can’t cover everything that the person may need. 

Another example would be how many low income families end up paying much more taxes than those who are “wealthier,” and those who are in high-class also get away from not paying taxes. As well those who are in a low income class are usually the ones who end up paying more, almost as if they can’t get out of that hole. Even when filing taxes the money that low income people get usually go straight to the unpaid bill or to food.
