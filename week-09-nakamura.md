Lisa  says “interactive media ask us to identify with someone else’s mental structure.” Nakumura basically says how we should try to understand the creator with the media that they are creating and posting in the media. Having us to relate to them in how they express themselves. 

What comes to my mind is instagram and TikTok many influencers and artist tend to post there whether its to promote their makeup or their art. Artist would post their stuff and later on would get hundred of followers and likes. Many also say how much they would hate the algorithm that these two apps have, some of their videos would end up in the wrong audience (and would receive hate for what they do) or they get shadow banned, which stops them from showing their content and expanding to newer audience.
