I have to agree that the internet can sometimes be dangerous place for kids as they donâ€™t know what is good or what is bad. As in Youtube or in other platforms they recommend you videos to watch. I do remember seeing some videos of knock off version of cartoons showing that were a little inappropriate videos.  As well I remember when I was around seven that there was this cartoon called Happy Tree Friends which was basically about animals that would go to adventures where they would somehow go horribly wrong. In this cartoon they would show like very gruesome and bloody scenes with guts out. In each episode they would start very innocent but they would later become violent. 


Many of the content showed in Youtube or in other places are controlled by bots. They go base off what the person watches, likes and comments or even subscribing to the channel and by that they would show people something similar to what they watch or something similar to that topic, which may lead to children viewing things that may not suitable for them. Bridle mentioned that Youtube might have to delete their system to stop content reaching the wrong audience which is really unlikely to happen. Honestly it would be impossible to find a solution to avoid this from happening.
