  # Gesamtkunstwerk
  Contemporary tools used to create art and would be considered Gesamtkunstwerk today in digital forms would be apps/programs like photoshop, illustrated, and procreate. The programs have help us by a lot, by creating something that is 2D to 3D making it easier for task to be delivered. For example, if people were to build a brand new store, they would have to make advertisements (online and in person), they would have to sketch the building, exterior and interior. They would be doing this with the software by sketching everything out and later on it will be passed to someone else to cheek the plans and see if they are accurate, and be able to tell if actual humans can go in. Together people who worked on the project will be creating a Gesamtkunstwerk.
  
  Theres many examples of Gesamtkunstwerk in Rhizome Anthology, s great example of a Gesamtkunstwerk  is the “Archangel Surfware” as Arcangel makes products for web surfing adding more media and methods to the product. His work only circulates through commercial internet without the mediation of art institutions or galleries.
